\chapter*{Abstract}
The following is a description of the work done by the candidate Francesca Lonedo during her three-hundred-and-twenty hours long curricular internship at THRON S.p.A. \\
Object detection is a computer vision related technology that deals with identifying instances of semantic class objects, and locating their position in digital images and videos. 
It has application in various domains, such as self-driving cars, video surveillance and image retrieval. \\
My project's goal was to develop a proof-of-concept prototype application to detect class instances and their location in image data. There are different approaches to solve such task, but I was asked to follow a \emph{\gls{deep learning}}\textsubscript{g} method that uses a \emph{\gls{convolutional neural network}}\textsubscript{g} called \emph{\gls{YOLO v3}}\textsubscript{g}. Furthermore, it was required to use a production-ready framework for development, and I was given the freedom to experiment with both \emph{\gls{MXNet}}\textsubscript{g} and \emph{\gls{TensorFlow}}\textsubscript{g} and to choose whichever I found more suitable for the project. \\
