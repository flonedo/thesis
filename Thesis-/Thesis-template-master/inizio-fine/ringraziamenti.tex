\chapter*{Thanks}

\noindent \textit{I want to thank my parents, for their endless love and support. They accepted my weird interests and gave me the opportunity to follow my dreams and graduate twice.}\\

\noindent \textit{
I want to thank my partner, who re-introduced me to computer science. He taught me a lot of things and always spoils me.}\\

\noindent \textit{I want to thank my friends, old and new, who kept me company on this journey.}\\

\noindent \textit{I want to thank my tutor and everyone at THRON for making my internship a wonderful learning experience.}
